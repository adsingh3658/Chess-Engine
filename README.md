# Chess Engine

A simple yet powerful chess engine capable of playing at ~2600 Elo on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/CodingAdventureBot/playing). While it performs well against human players, it still lags behind advanced engines like Stockfish.

This project uses the **UCI (Universal Chess Interface)** protocol to communicate with external chess GUIs and platforms. Note that it does **not include a graphical interface** and is a minimal implementation designed primarily for Lichess integration.
